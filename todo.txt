ToDo
e Implement efficient and easy to use rendering framework

In Progress
q Implement new renderer
  e stage 1 - render a single polygon to the window
	- Restructure scene to contain just a single simple polygon
	- Get polygon rendering working with the new shader, not worrying about efficiency
	
Done
q Implement new renderer
  e stage 1 - render a single polygon to the window
  	- Implement a simple shader that works with SDL3
	- Look into the shader cross compiler that can be used with SDL3 (used Vulkan SDK for glsl to spir-v)
	- Integrate shader compilation in CMake
e Transition to SDL3
  - Implement mouse scroll handling
  - Implement keyboard input handling
  - Implement window events
  - Remove all GLFW references outside of window
  - Add SDL3 as a submodule
  - Add SDL3 dependecies
  - Create a window and make sure the program runs
  - Implement four callbacks in separate modules using function forwarding
  - Implement clear screen in SDL3 GPU and Vulkan initialization
  - Get IMGUI and the GUI layer running
  - Get the game running
- Implement untransformed bounding boxes when instantiating the scene
- Render untransformed bounding boxes for each node
- Implement construct on first use
- Fix memory access violation in release mode
- Enable move camera by right mouse button and drag
- Implement multiple render counters
- Move shaders to geometry renderer
- Implement test outline rendering
- Create outline class derived from renderable
- Refactor polygon generation routines into separate module
- Create renderable, generalization of polygon
- Derive polygon from renderable
- Generalize geometry buffer class to support general renderables
c Implement hierarchical scene rendering with transforms
	- Implement rendering one node at a time with traversal
	- Implement transforms for each node 
	- Implement node updates and rotate deltas (mainly for debugging for now)
	- Optimize rendering by batching nodes that don't need transform
	- Support proper hierarchy in scene loader and rendering
- Ensure Oya is working on the work laptop
- Remove all previous data triggers and listeners
- Remove listeners from the Layer classes
- Implement event system across all of Oya
- Transition back to Visual Studio (needed copilot features are now supported in preview)
